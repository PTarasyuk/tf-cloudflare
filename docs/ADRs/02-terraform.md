# ADR-02: Using Terraform for Managing Cloudflare Configurations

Date: yyyy-mm-dd

## 1. Title

Using Terraform as the Primary Tool for Cloudflare Configuration Management

## 2. Status

Accepted

## 3. Context

For effective management of Cloudflare infrastructure, including DNS records, security rules, CDN settings, and other components, a reliable and flexible tool that supports infrastructure configuration codification is required.

## 4. Problem Statement

Manual management of Cloudflare infrastructure can lead to errors, is difficult to scale, and does not provide an adequate level of documentation and change tracking.

## 5. Decision

It has been decided to use Terraform for managing all aspects of Cloudflare's infrastructure.
Terraform allows for the codification of infrastructure configurations, facilitating automation, reducing the risk of errors, improving documentation, and simplifying the change process.
The use of Terraform for Cloudflare includes:

- Managing DNS records
- Configuring security rules, including WAF
- CDN configuration and content optimization
- Managing SSL/TLS certificates
- Automating deployments and updates

## 6. Consequences

Using Terraform will provide more efficient and error-free infrastructure management, reduce the time for deployments and configuration updates.
However, it requires the team to have knowledge of Terraform and spend time on initial setup.

## 7. Technical Implications

It's necessary to develop Terraform configurations for all aspects of the Cloudflare infrastructure, set up CI/CD processes for deployment automation, and implement versioning and change tracking practices.

## 8. Alternatives

Other infrastructure management tools such as Pulumi were considered.
However, Terraform was chosen due to its stability, maturity, and extensive community support.
As one of the most mature Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools, Terraform offers broad provider support, including almost all major cloud platforms, allowing teams to easily codify, configure, and manage their infrastructure.
Terraform's declarative approach simplifies the understanding and management of infrastructure, especially in complex environments, providing greater transparency and efficiency in the deployment process.

On the other hand, Pulumi offers an innovative approach by allowing developers to use familiar programming languages to describe and manage infrastructure, which may appeal to those who prefer a more programmatic approach.

## 9. Recommendations

It is recommended to conduct training sessions for the team on Terraform basics, develop standardized templates for configurations, and establish continuous monitoring and review processes to ensure the infrastructure remains efficient and secure.

## 10. Responsible

- The DevOps team is responsible for developing Terraform configurations and setting up CI/CD processes.
- The security team provides configuration of security rules and vulnerability tracking.
