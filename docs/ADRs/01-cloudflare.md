# ADR-01: Utilizing Cloudflare

Date: yyyy-mm-dd

## 1. Title

Utilizing Cloudflare as the Primary Platform for Web Optimization, Security, and Distributed Data Storage

## 2. Status

Accepted

## 3. Context

Our project requires a reliable, scalable, and secure infrastructure to handle web requests, store data, optimize content, and protect against web threats.
Cloudflare offers a comprehensive suite of services that include CDN, WAF (Web Application Firewall), DNS, DDoS protection, and Cloudflare Workers for custom edge network logic, which can meet these needs.

## 4. Problem Statement

To ensure high availability, fast content delivery, security, and scalability, the integration of a suite of services is necessary.
Choosing a platform that can provide a comprehensive set of tools to achieve these goals is crucial.

## 5. Decision

The decision to use Cloudflare as the primary platform for all project needs, including web optimization, security, and distributed data storage, is based on the following advantages of Cloudflare:

- **CDN and Content Optimization**: Ensures fast content delivery with minimal latency.
- **WAF and DDoS Protection**: Protects the website from threats and attacks.
- **Cloudflare Workers**: Allows for executing custom logic at the network edge to optimize web requests.
- **DNS**: Provides fast and reliable DNS management.
- **Cloudflare Pages and R2 Bucket**: Offer a platform for static hosting and data storage.

## 6. Consequences

Using Cloudflare will enhance our website's performance and security, reduce page load times, and provide scalable data storage.
However, reliance on a single provider may create risks for service availability in the event of provider outages.

## 7. Technical Implications

Integration with Cloudflare will require DNS setup, WAF rules configuration, CDN configuration, and the development of custom Workers scripts.
Integration with Cloudflare Pages and R2 Bucket for website hosting and data storage will also be necessary.

## 8. Alternatives

Other platforms such as AWS and Google Cloud, which also provide similar services, were considered.
However, their integration and management were found to be more complex and costly compared to the all-encompassing solution offered by Cloudflare.

## 9. Recommendations

It is recommended to conduct detailed technical planning for integration with Cloudflare, develop a backup and recovery strategy to ensure high availability, and perform load testing to assess the performance and scalability of the solution.

## 10. Responsible

- The DevOps team is responsible for integrating and customizing services.
- The security team ensures WAF configuration and threat monitoring.
